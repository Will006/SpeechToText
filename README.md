Goal of the Project:

  Build experience
  Sampling data at specific intervals
  Using Fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms
  Using direct memory access (DMA)
  A particle device to use in future projects
  
The device would
  Receive input from a human voice 
  Convert phonic sounds to a string of characters
  Use a spell checker algorithm to convert the string of characters to a list of valid words
  Output the words as if being typed form a keyboard

Implemented on a STM32F446VET6 reading analog voltage from a MAX9814 breakout board.
